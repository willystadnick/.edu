# The Outpost Attack Detection Plug-in consists of two parts:
# 	* Outpost Scanning Detection module.
# 	* Outpost Attack Detection module.
# 
# The Outpost Attack Detection module detects and blocks the following 
# attacks-also called exploits or Denial Of Service (DOS) attacks:
#	* Teardrop
#	* Nestea
#	* Iceping
#	* Moyari13
#	* Winnuke
#	* Nuke
#	* FRAG_ICMP Class (Jol12, Targa13 and other)
#	* FRAG_IGMP Class (IGMPSYN and other)
#	* SHORT_FRAGMENTS Class
#	* MY_ADDRESS Class (Snork and others)
#	* Rst
#	* 1234
#	* Fawx
#	* Fawx2
#	* Kox
#	* Tidcmp
#	* Rfposion
#	* Rfparalyse
#	* Win95handles
# The Outpost Attack Detection module can also detect and neutralize 
# distributed DOS attacks.
# 
# The Outpost Scanning Detection module can detect simple TCP and UDP port
# scanning as well as the following types of stealth scanning: 
# Syn, Fin, Xmas, Null, Udp.
# 
# Usually scan detectors in most Personal Firewalls detect a Port Scan 
# (also called TCP port scanning or port probe) if someone connects to any 
# closed port on the local PC. However, this approach results in a great
# number of false alarms because often-valid software needing to interchange
# data routinely checks for open or closed ports. 
# 
# To decrease the number of false alarms Outpost's Scanning Detection Module 
# differentiates between single scan of a closed port (a suspicious packet)
# and several accesses to different ports by the same remote host.
# 
# Outpost designates a packet as suspicious if it is a: 
# 1. TCP Connection request or UDP packet to a non-open port.
# 2. TCP data packet for a non-existent connection.
# 3. TCP Connection request or UDP packet to a port closed by Outpost.
# If Outpost detects a suspicious packet, it displays the "Connection request" 
# message in its log file.
# 
# Port Scanning is another intrusion indicator that is detected if several 
# suspicious packets are received from one remote host within a specified 
# time interval.
# 
# Using the settings below you can fine-tune the Outpost Attack Detection 
# Plug-in settings. Do NOT modify a setting without understanding what 
# that setting is for. If there is any uncertainty, please consult the on-line 
# documents or Agnitum Support. This is an important point so please take this 
# warning seriously.  
# 
# 
# All time intervals are in milliseconds.
# 
# The number of suspicious packets detected before Outpost reports 
# "Port Scan Detected":

N(1) = 2	#maximum alert level
N(2) = 6	#normal alert level
N(3) = 12	#minimum alert level

# Bit mask of allowed checks for disabling the detection of some attacks:
T1 = 65535

# Outpost will report Port scanning if N (see above) suspicious packets 
# are detected from one host within the time T2.
T2 = 600

# After a Port Scan is detected, the plug-in will ignore the attacking host 
# for the time T3. This interval is needed to protect from a great number of 
# "Port Scan detected" messages if someone is scanning all your ports.
T3 = 6000

# After disconnecting from a valid remote host it might try to send another 
# packet to the same local port not knowing that the port was closed by 
# application that had opened this port. To prevent false alarms in this case,
# the plug-in will forget about these local ports and remote hosts 
# for the time T4.
T4 = 3000

# The number of different remote hosts detected in a distributed DOS attack. 
# This is used for detecting an attack in which different remote hosts 
# participate or if the attacker employs IP spoofing. In this case,
# a DOS attack will be detected if the number of remote hosts sending 
# suspicious packets to one port on your system exceeds T5 during the time 
# interval T2. 
T5 = 100

# The maximum number of remote hosts detected in an attack after which the 
# attack is ignored for the time T3.  This setting is needed to prevent a 
# great number of "Attack detected" messages if an attacker uses IP spoofing 
# or different remote hosts.
T6 = 10

# This is the minimum fragment size for the 
# PROTECT_ENABLE_SHORT_FRAGMENTS_DETECT. Fragments (excluding the last one in 
# a packet) smaller than T7 will be considered an attack.
T7=128

# During the time, T8 the plug-in will try to assemble packets from fragments.
# After the time T8 has been exceeded the plug-in will abort the task.
T8=50      

# Maximum number of unassembled packets for an OPENTEAR exploit detection.
T9=30     

# During the time T10 after an OPENTEAR attack is detected, all fragmented
# packets will be blocked.
T10=600     

# During the time T11 after NUKE packets are received, the connection will be 
# protected from disconnection.
T11=6000    

# The number of RST packets for an RST attack detection is T12
T12=5       


# Ports That are Typically Vulnerable
# 
# Even one suspicious packet sent to a Typical Vulnerable Port (for example 
# 31337, 111 or 139) is considered an attempt to gain unauthorized access 
# to your system. That is why some ports are given more weight than others 
# and can trigger a "Port Scan Detected" message even with only one suspicious 
# packet received. 
# 
# The description of a vulnerable port has the following format:
# 
# Protocol PortNumber Weight Bind UseForAllPackets
# 
# Protocol and PortNumber are self-explanatory.
# 
# Weight is the significance a port has. For example, a weight of 3 for 
# port 111 means that a single suspicious packet to this port is equal to 3 
# suspicious packets sent to another port that is weighted at 1.
# 
# Bind is the number of the Network Interface. For example, you can specify 
# that a packet from a Network Card for a LAN is not counted as suspicious 
# but a packet from a Network Card to the Internet is to be considered 
# suspicious. This can be used for Routers and Gateways.
# If Bind is 0 it is used for All Binds.
# 
# UseForAllPackets. If set to 1 every connection request to this port will be 
# counted as suspicious, no matter if it was blocked or allowed by the 
# Firewall, and whether or not the port is open or closed.
